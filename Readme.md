### To Do

* Move javascript rewritten code into separate file.
* Style text, to align with middle of play button

### Errors

The following message existed originally in the console, and still persists. Looks to be a CORS error. Perhaps it's this problem: https://benohead.com/cross-document-communication-with-iframes/  But, the page loads, so this could be pursued later.

```
